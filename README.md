# Markov-Model
Data Structures: This project is meant to showcase the slightly more complex Data Types that include binary search trees, sorted dictionaries, and sorted list. It uses a Markov chain for each of these three models to string together words until it hits the desired length that the user inputs along with measuring efficiency of each data type.
